Print and audio stories in the Graying Pains series are produced by members of The Montana Fourth Estate Project, which have first publication rights to all content. Graying Pains stories are published by Fourth Estate partners on a schedule of one per week, starting March 12, 2020, and continuing through August 2020. 
 
All Graying Pains stories are available for free re-publication by any Montana news outlet starting two weeks after the storyâ€™s initial publication. Story materials will be distributed via email to Montana Newspaper Association member publications as they are available for re-publication. 
 
If you are a non-MNA member publication that wishes to re-publish Graying Pains stories, or have any questions regarding re-publication, please contact Montana Free Press editor Brad Tyer at [btyer@montanafrepress.org](mailto:btyer@montanafrepress.org).
