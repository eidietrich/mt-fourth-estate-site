The Montana Fourth Estate Project is a collaboration among 15 Montana newspapers, Yellowstone Public Radio, the University of Montana School of Journalism, and Montana Free Press. Its purpose is to leverage the resources of statewide media to provide coordinated, in-depth coverage of important social issues to readers in communities big and small, rural and urban, all across the state. 
 
The collaboration formed to create an inaugural reporting series titled Graying Pains: Challenges and Opportunities in the Westâ€™s Oldest State. Graying Pains is funded by the [Montana Newspaper Association](https://www.mtnewspapers.com/) with support from the [Solutions Journalism Network](https://www.mtnewspapers.com/), a nonprofit that promotes rigorous reporting on responses to social problems. Funding has been provided by the [LOR Foundation](https://lorfoundation.org/) and the [Kendeda Fund](https://kendedafund.org/).

[Montana Free Press](https://montanafreepress.org/), a Helena-based statewide nonprofit news organization, is coordinating the collaboration. For more information, contact Project Editor Brad Tyer at [btyer@montanafreepress.org](mailto:btyer@montanafreepress.org).
